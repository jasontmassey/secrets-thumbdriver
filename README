secrets-thumbdriver


Overview
--------

In English: this secrets-thumbdriver utility enables you to encrypt a group of
files into a format which is then easy to write to a thumb-drive. When
finished, the next time you insert your thumb-drive into a Linux desktop
machine, you'll be prompted for your password, then be able to access your
files.

In Nerd: secrets-thumbdriver creates a disk-image file ('image-secrets')
within the current directory which is GUID-partitioned with a single
LUKS-encrypted vfat partition whose contents are files you specify from a
'payload' directory. You may then `dd` this file to a series of thumb-drives.


How to use
----------

Clone this repo.

Place the secrets you wish to have encrypted into the 'payload' directory.

invoke `./secrets-thumbdriver`

`dd` the resultant 'image-secrets' disk-image file to a device of your choice,
for example:

sudo dd if=image-secrets of=/dev/sda status=progress ; sudo sync
